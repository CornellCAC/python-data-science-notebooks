This repository provides supplementary material (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and data files) for use with the Cornell Virtual Workshop (CVW) tutorial on <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-data-science">Python for Data Science</a>.

The code in this repository was run in a conda environment named pydatasci through a series of installs as follows:

* conda create -n pydatasci numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy networkx bokeh jupyter ipython scikit-learn xlrd openpyxl statsmodels sqlachemy
* conda activate pydatasci
