Repository of notebooks and data to accompany the Cornell Virtual Workshop (CVW) tutorial on <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-data-science">Python for Data Science</a>.

Twitter data sets

The Twitter-associated data sets for use with this tutorial are not stored within the github repository because they are too large.  Instead, they are stored separately at the locations indicated below.

Three files are available, although you can decide which ones you want to download based on the information below.

Available files:

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-data-science/datasets/twitter/climatechange_2018_11_26_17_19_15_679824.json  (size: approximately 156 MB)

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-data-science/datasets/twitter/climatechange_2018_11_27_11_30_06_972631.json  (size: approximately 145 MB)

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-data-science/datasets/twitter/climatechange_tweets_all.csv  (size: approximately 119 MB)

Notes:

(1) The json files are needed only if you want to run the code described in the CVW section on <a href="https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/python-data-science/preparing-data/extract-reorganize-data">Extracting and Reorganizing Data</a> and in the associated Jupyter notebook named climatechange_extract_data_from_twitter_json_example.ipynb .  If you are not interested in doing that preprocessing and only want to work with the filtered csv file used in subsequent sections, you do not need to download the json files.

(2) The large csv file climatechange_tweets_all.csv is the only dataset needed to run the code contained in the notebook named climatechange_tweet_timelines.ipynb and described in the tutorial page at https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/PyDataSci1/tweets_retweets .
